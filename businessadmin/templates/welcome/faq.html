              <h5>How does Gibele work?</h5>
              <p class="text-muted mb-4">Gibele offers a straightforward web application which allows you to view your booking schedule, add or cancel appointments for any service and offers a platform which your clients can use to stay connected with you.</p>
              <h5>What is a Booking Page URL?</h5>
              <p class="text-muted mb-4">The Booking Page URL refers to the url which Gibele offers to your business which can be put in your Instagram bio's, embedded in your business websites and/or shared to your clients. This URL will take your clients to your booking page where they can view all of the services that you have to offer and schedule an appointment based on the availability of your schedule.</p>
              <p class="text-muted mb-4">This allows your clients to view your availability and schedule themselves in for appointments without having to contact you directly.</p>
              </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <h5>What is a Business Page?</h5>
              <p class="text-muted mb-4">Your business page will be listed on the Gibele marketplace where potential customers can read reviews and look at the services that your business has to offer. You can customize this business page by adding a banner image, up to 10 images to the gallary section of your business and list amenities to showcase to the world what your business has to offer!</p>
              <h5>How do we stay connected with clients?</h5>
              <p class="text-muted mb-4">We offer an online marketplace where potential customers can browse and view all of the services you have to offer from your Booking Page. Depending on the subscription your business has with Gibele, we send out email notifications and text message reminders to your clients to ensure they are ready for their booked appointment.</p>

              <h5>Stripe</h5>
              <p class="text-muted mb-4">All payments will be handled with Stripe.</p>
              <h5>Payment methods accepted</h5>
              <p class="text-muted mb-4">The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. &quot;What's happened to me?&quot; he thought. It wasn't a dream.</p>

              <h5>Gibele Service Fees</h5>
              <p class="text-muted mb-4">For businesses under the 'BASIC TIER and PREMIUM TIER' plan, there is no Gibele service fee charged to your customers or to the business.</p>
              <p class="text-muted mb-4">For businesses under the 'MID TIER' plan, a service fee will only be charged when Gibele has to process a deposit for a service or process a cancellation fee. The service fee in this case will only be 0.5% of the processed deposit or cancellation fee. Businesses have the option to forward this cost to their clients.</p>
              <p class="text-muted mb-4">For businesses under all plans, Stripe fees are still included.</p>

              <h5>My product has a problem what should I do?</h5>
              <p class="text-muted mb-4">He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before.</p>
              <h5>What if the product is broken?</h5>
              <p class="text-muted mb-4">One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections</p>
